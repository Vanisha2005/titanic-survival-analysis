# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to uncover patterns in passenger survival. Using Python in Google Colab, we focused on demographic and class-based survival trends.

## 📊 Overview

- Analyzed survival distribution based on gender, class, age, and embarkation point.
- Cleaned and prepared data using Pandas.
- Visualized patterns with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🔍 Features

- Survival vs. Gender analysis
- Class-wise survival visualization
- Age distribution of survivors
- Combined visual insights (gender + class)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Load the Titanic dataset from Kaggle or `seaborn.load_dataset('titanic')`
3. Run cells sequentially for cleaning, analysis, and visualization

## 📚 What I Learned

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques
- Creating insightful visualizations
- Working with real-world datasets
- Survival pattern interpretation
